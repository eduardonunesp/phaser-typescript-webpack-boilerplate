# Phaser TypeScript Webpack Boilerplate

Start developing your own HTML5 games using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Phaser.io](http://phaser.io/)

## Requirements

* Node.JS
* NPM

You can install Node by downloading on the site [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## How to

Clone this project in any directory and type `npm install` to install all dependencies and to run the project just type `npm start`. It will start to listen at port 9000, open your favorite web browser at address [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) and start to code your game on `src` directory.

And to distribute your game just run `npm build` it will create the `dist` directory with all necessary files, ready to push to any HTTP server.

**Debug**

To debug with [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) install the [chrome debugger](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug) extension and then go to the console and run `npm start` and then click anywhere in the editor and press `F5`
setup any breakpoints and that's it.
